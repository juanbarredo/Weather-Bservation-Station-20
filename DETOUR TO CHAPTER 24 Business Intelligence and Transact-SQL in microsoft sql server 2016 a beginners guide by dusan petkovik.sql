--I am going to type this out instead of using the mindmapping software.

--I think I don't need to map to get a layout.

--I need to hit the weeds right now.

--The SQL standard has adopted a set of online analytical processing (OLAP) f
--functions that enable you to easily perdomr these calculations and many others
--that used to be very complex for implementation.

--this part of the SQL standar is called SQL/OLAP 

--therefore, 
--SQL/OLAP comprises all functions and operators that are used for data analysis.

--using OLAP functions has several advantages fro users:

----users with standard knwledge of SQL can easily specify the calculations they need.

----databasae systems, such as the database engine, can perform these calculations more efficiently.

----because there is a standard specification of these functions,
----they're now much more economical for tool and application vendors to exploit.

----almost all analytical functions proposed by the SQL standard are implemented in enterprise
----database systems int he same way.
----for this reason, 
----you can port queries in relation to SQL/OLAP from one system to another,
----without any code changes.

--so, 

--I am feeling frustrated that I wasted my attention span on something that I am hoping pays off.

--we shall see.

--i am honestly stuck otherwise.
