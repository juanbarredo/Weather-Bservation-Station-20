----ok,

----I am going to start exploring Chapter 10 in the SQL book.
----The SQL book is " Microsoft SQL Server 2016 : A Beginner's Guide "

--Chapter 10 :

--Indices:

----I believe that Indices will help me solve the Median problem I am having.

--Introduction
--Transact-SQL and indices.
--Guidelines for Creating and Using Indices.
--Special Types of Indices.

----I am excited for all of this.

--This chapter describes indices and their role in optimizing the response time of queries.

--The fisr part of the chapter discusses how indices are stored and the existing form of them.

----Perfect! I believe that this covers it.
----becuase I was wondering that I might not be able to make an index on the HackerRank interface.
----I know previously I had problems in solving another problem
----where I wanted to create a whole new column.
----which made me have to get better at nested functions.
----so, if there already are "existing forms of them".
----"them" being indices.
----then, I might not need to add a whole new index_column.

--The main part of the chapter
--explains three Transact-SQL statements pertaining to indices:
--CREATE INDEX,
--ALTER INDEX,
--and
--DROP INDEX.

----ok,
----I am really hoping I can either use an already existing column as an index.
----if there isn't an already existing one.
----why wouldn't there already be an existing index?

--After that,
--index fragmentation and its impact
--on the performance of the system will be explained.

--The next part of the chapter gives you several general recommendations
--for how and when indices should be created.

----I am also exited for that part of the chapter.
----I am sure there are many reasons to create an idex.

--The final part of the chapter describes several special types of indices.

--INTRODUCTION:

--Databas systems generally use indices to provide fast access to relational data.
--an index is a separate physical data structure that enables queries to access one of more data rows fast.

----I am getting discouraged that maybe 
----I think I found something.
----I am exited.
