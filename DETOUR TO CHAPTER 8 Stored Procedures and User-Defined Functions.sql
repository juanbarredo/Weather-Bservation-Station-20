----I am going to work on Chapter 8
----Stored Procedures and User-Defined Functions.

--In this Chapter
--	Procedural Extensions
--	Stored Procedures
--	User-Defined Functions

----I believe that I will just work on the Procedural Extensions part

--This chapter introduces bathces and routines.

--A batch is 
--a sequence of Transact-SQL statements 
--and procedural extensions.

----ok, this is a new and very important concept to me.

----batches.

--A routine can be either a stored procedure or a user-defined function (UDF).

----I don't think I care about routines right now.

----yeah, batches seems to be the thing that will help me solve for the median.

--The beginning of the chapter introduces all procedural extensions supported by the database engine.
--After that,
--procedural extensions are used,
--together with Transact-SQL statements,
--to show how batches can be implemented.

--A batch can be stored as a database object,
--as either a stored procedure or a UDF.

--Some stored procedures are written by users,
--and others are provided by Microsoft and are reffered to as 
--system stored procedures.

--In contrastj to user-defined stored procedures,
--UDFs return a value to a caller.
